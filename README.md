# Couchbase Lite Common Java Code

This repo contains code common to all Couchbase Lite Java Products

## Issues

Please file any issues against the appropriate product root:

- For the Android product, use couchbase-lite-android-ce [here](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-android-ce)
- For the pure Java product, use couchbase-lite-java-ce (TBD)

It is a completely new implementation, utterly divergent from
the 1.x project that formerly occupied this space.
